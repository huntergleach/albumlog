Welcome to Record Collector Lite! 

This is a way to keep track of your record collection digitally, for viewing any time, anywhere. 

Just fill out the form with the information, upload your artwork and click Log It! 

At the bottom of the page you will see a collection of album artwork displayed, but all the information is stored underneath the art. Hover over to reveal! 



In order to use, you will need to install a json server locally on your machine using this command in your terminal 

    npm install -g json-server

Then navigate in your terminal to the 'albumlog-final' directory, which contins the db.json file

Enter this into your terminal to connect the server to the json file
(make sure you are cd'd into the albumlog-final directory to grab the right json file!) 

    json-server --watch db.json



Happy collecting!
